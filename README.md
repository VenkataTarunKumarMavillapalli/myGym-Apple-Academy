You can check the app prototype in this link https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ua2wWZpHHfvpqlmJ-T8vmoT7lpugIPQt/view?usp=sharing


In MyGym.zip, I have uploaded the code to run the app.

Apple Developer Academy 

ï»¿We have started with Big Idea & Challenge Statement(Miro), where we tried many ideas, Exploring the App Store & Questioning. We have done Research Synthesis. Generated many app concepts using the Lotus Blossom technique. The Course is based on Challenge Based Learning(CBL). Then we created a presentation of our App Concept that contains an app Statement(KeyNote), a list of the most important User Stories, a few sketched screens. We then started using Figma for prototyping designs. We also got introduced to the Human Interface Guidelines for creating prototype, got our prototype reviewed, had Easter vacation. Applied the Mid-term Review feedback to our app! We then used SwiftUI and Xcode for developing the application. Concluded with Final Presentation.

Got used to many tools like Figma, Miro, Keynote, Notion Productivity Software, SF symbols, TestFlight. Luckily developed few skills App Development Lifecycle, Swift, Feedback development, Team Management. Overview of the application we built - We started with mental health as our big idea, which is very complex so we thought of building an app on Organising events for students audience. We then targeted a much smaller audience on people who have physical workout everyday. How might we help gymaholic improve their workout by managing their workout plans. As we all were having a very busy schedule, hence we created the prototype & app poster in future we will add some more features and then publish it in the app store.
